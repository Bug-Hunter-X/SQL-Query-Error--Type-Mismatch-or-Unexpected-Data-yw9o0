```sql
-- Solution 1: Explicit type conversion
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND CAST(salary AS DECIMAL(10,2)) > 100000;

-- Solution 2:  Using TRIM to handle whitespace
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE TRIM(department) = 'Sales' AND CAST(salary AS DECIMAL(10,2)) > 100000;

-- Solution 3:  Adding error handling (depends on specific SQL dialect)
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND CAST(salary AS DECIMAL(10,2)) > 100000;

IF @@ERROR <> 0
BEGIN
    -- Handle the error (e.g., log it, return a default value)
    PRINT 'Error occurred in data type conversion or filtering.';
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
END ELSE
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
